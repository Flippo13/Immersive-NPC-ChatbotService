  utter_appearance_veeq:
  - text: He looks like an Airkru, but with mechanical parts
  - text: He's half Airkru and half cyborg
  - text: He has a robot arm and leg. For the rest he looks like a normal Airkru
  - text: He's an Airkru with a robot right arm and right leg
  utter_ask_who:
  - text: 'Who are you talking about? '
  utter_backstory:
  - text: I come from nowhere. What does it matter anyway?
  utter_compliment:
  - text: oh, thanks
  - text: Thank you, I guess?
  - text: Thanks
  utter_comply:
  - text: Alright, I will answer your questions. Calm down
  utter_default:
  - text: I am sorry, I dont know what that means. Got any other questions?
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  - text: Goodbye
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hey
  - text: Hello
  - text: Hi
  utter_info:
  - text: I don't know what the info is about. I didn't ask. The less I know, the
      better
  - text: I don't know what I stole. I don't care. I don't care about any of this
  - text: I never asked Akemaz what the info was. My task was to get it, not ask questions.
      If you want to know what it is, ask Akemaz
  utter_info_location:
  - text: I gave the data stick containing the info to Akemaz
  - text: I don't know. I gave it to Akemaz. I'm guessing he hid it somewhere
  - text: I don't have it, nor do I know where it is. Ask Akemaz
  utter_insult:
  - text: Fuck you!
  - text: Asshole
  utter_location_veeq:
  - text: I don't know where he is
  - text: I dunno
  - text: I have no idea
  - text: I really don't know
  utter_mood:
  - text: shit
  utter_motive:
  - text: I need the money. I... Please, it's not what you think. I don't care about
      being rich or powerful, not anymore. I just want to get away from it all
  - text: I just want the money so that I can start somewhere new
  - text: I don't care about the politics, about Raih, or even about Akemaz or Veeq.
      I want to start a new life somewhere with the one I love, and I need money for
      that
  utter_motive_akemaz:
  - text: Akemaz? I barely know him. Don't know exactly why he's doing this, and honestly,
      I don't really care
  - text: He's probably doing it for the thrill of it. And for the money, of course.
      I don't really know him that well
  - text: I don't what his motive is. Whatever it might be, I'm sure it's nothing
      good. But that's his business, not mine, I only care about my own.
  utter_motive_veeq:
  - text: I don't know. I don't know the guy
  - text: I've never even spoken to him, how am I supposed to know?
  - text: Don't know, don't care.
  utter_name:
  - text: Rinnol
  - text: My name is Rinnol
  - text: Its Rinnol
  utter_name_veeq:
  - text: His name is Veeq, I think
  - text: Pretty sure that Veeq is his name
  - text: I thought it was Veeq, could be wrong though
  utter_negative:
  - text: 'No'
  - text: That is wrong
  - text: Not true
  utter_personality_akemaz:
  - text: I don't know him that well, so I'm not sure. All I know is that you better
      not trust him. You never know what he might be up to.
  - text: Akemaz is... not trustworthy. That's all I know.
  utter_personality_veeq:
  - text: Look, I've only seen him once or twice. We've never even exchanged words.
      I don't know the guy
  - text: Absolutely no idea. He didn't talk much.
  utter_positive:
  - text: 'Yes'
  - text: That is correct
  - text: Sure
  utter_request_reward:
  - text: You gotta give me something, I cant help you unless you help me, if the
      information is so important, there has to be an reward for me if I help you
      to get it back.
  - text: Look, I am stuck here. But it seems to me that they really want the information
      back quick. If you pull some strings to help me, I might be able to help you
  utter_role:
  - text: Akemaz told me to hack into the station's systems to retrieve some data.
      I didn't ask any questions
  - text: I stole some secret info, nothing more, nothing less
  utter_role_akemaz:
  - text: Akemaz planned everything. You should be asking him the questions, not me
  - text: Akemaz sees himself as our leader, which is accurate I guess.
  - text: Akemaz is the mastermind behind the whole plan. He's the one you want.
  utter_role_veeq:
  - text: Veeq is good with tools. He managed to get us in unnoticed via the docks
  utter_state_rewards:
  - text: I need you to promise me that you can get me out if I help you
  utter_thank_you:
  - text: Thank you, ask me your questions
